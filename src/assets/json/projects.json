        "description": "In this project, I utilized a combination of cutting-edge technologies to develop a robust e-commerce platform. The frontend was built using AngularJS, a powerful JavaScript framework known for its flexibility and efficiency in crafting dynamic user interfaces. Leveraging the utility-first CSS framework Tailwind CSS, I ensured a sleek and responsive design that enhances user experience across various devices. For the backend infrastructure, I employed Node.js, a server-side runtime environment renowned for its scalability and speed. With Node.js, I created a resilient backend system capable of handling high volumes of traffic and concurrent user interactions. To manage the database operations efficiently, I utilized MySQL through Knex.js, enabling seamless data manipulation and retrieval.",
